# SVM Image Classifier for Cats and Dogs

## Objective

Build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs using the Cats vs. Dogs dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Cats Dogs Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/5226945).

## Project Structure

- **SVM_cats_or_dogs.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the SVM image classification code.
- **drive/MyDrive/dataset/cats_dogs_light/cats_dogs_light/train**: Training dataset folder.
- **drive/MyDrive/dataset/cats_dogs_light/cats_dogs_light/test**: Testing dataset folder.

## Libraries Used

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- skimage
- seaborn (for visualization)
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `SVM_cats_or_dogs.ipynb` in a Colab environment.
2. Mount your Google Drive.
3. Run the notebook cells to load, preprocess, and train the SVM model.
4. Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Confusion Matrix Heatmap:** Visual representation of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score Bar Chart:** Visualization of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Results

The SVM model's accuracy and performance metrics are displayed in the notebook. Additionally, confusion matrix heatmap and bar charts provide insights into the model's classification performance.
